		<h1>Victor Ruggi</h1>
		<p id="bio">I am a graduate of the Computer Science Technology program at Dawson College in Montreal, Quebec. 
		I have finished in the honors list three times before graduating. Despite multiple setbacks and hurdles, I finally graduated in June of 2018.
		<br/><br/>
		I have previously developed an Android app that simulates bowling games for personal use. I also made plenty of single-class Java applications
		that simulate games, game shows, and other real-world situations.
		<br/><br/>
		Other apps I have made include a Montreal Metro Hotspot Finder app, where a user can see every nearby hotspot (tourist area, restaurant, point of interest, etc.)
		that is nearby any given station of the Montreal Metro. This app was made for personal use on my iPhone through iGenApps and will soon be available as a Web version.</p>
